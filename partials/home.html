                <p>Silk foliage offers many advantages over its live counterparts. Today's permanent botanicals have evolved to the look and feel of live plants. Beck' Silk Plant Company provides permanent botanicals and silk foliage that are so life-like, they are difficult to distinguish from live plants. Beck's maintains an inventory of the very finest silk foliage available in the marketplace today.</p>

                <p>Many people have difficulty maintaining live plants due to lighting, maintenance and time constraints. Silk plants offer a low maintenance alternative, while providing the same warmth and style of live botanicals. In addition, permanent botanicals do not attract insects, require no pesticides and create an allergy-free environment.
