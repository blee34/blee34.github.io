                <p>For locations such as airport, hotels, offices, banks, restaurants, and model homes, silk foliage offers a cost-effective savings over a monthly lease-maintenance contract for live plants. In addition, silk plants are ideal for high-security areas, eliminating the need for the continuous personnel access live botanicals require.
